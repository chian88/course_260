# Presentation

Data modeling: How do you model boards, lists, cards, comments, and labels? They are "hierarchical" entities and can be modeled using either references or embedding. Did you choose one or the other or a combination, and why?

Assumptions: What assumptions did you make in order to limit the scope of the project? You should make reasonable assumptions how the app is going to be used, such as, the typical board would have up to a few thousand cards, and be aware of the implications of how you implement features.

Client and server communication: How did you design the API endpoints? What modeling choices did you make on the frontend and backend? How often are Ajax requests made and how large is their typical payload?

Structure: How did you chose to structure and organize the project's code and files? Why?

Libraries: What library research did you do, and how did this influence your choices?

Challenges: What difficulties did you face and overcome (or not)? Would you do anything differently next time?

- how to put Cards collection into List.
- how to add labels to the card and refresh it in the data file.

- how to have a separate data to store available labels.

- how to have the labels point to a master list using ID.

Future improvements: What additional functionality would you implement if you have the time?
